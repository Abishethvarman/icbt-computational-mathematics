# 📚 Introduction to Sets in Mathematics

## 1. What is a Set?

**Definition**:  
A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or **members**.

**Notation**:
- Sets are denoted using **curly brackets** `{ }`
- Elements are separated by **commas**

**Examples**:
- Set of vowels: `A = {a, e, i, o, u}`
- Set of even numbers less than 10: `E = {2, 4, 6, 8}`
- Set of colors in a rainbow: `R = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet}`

**Shortcut Tip**: Think of sets like containers holding unique items — duplicates are not allowed.

## 2. Types of Sets

### 🔹 Finite and Infinite Sets
- **Finite Set**: Has a countable number of elements  
  e.g., `B = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
- **Infinite Set**: Has endless elements  
  e.g., `N = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}` (natural numbers)

### 🔹 Empty Set (Null Set)
- Contains **no elements**
- Denoted by `{ }` or `∅`  
  e.g., `X = ∅` (Set of square circles)

### 🔹 Singleton Set
- Contains **only one element**  
  e.g., `S = {0}`

### 🔹 Equal and Equivalent Sets
- **Equal**: Same elements, order doesn't matter  
  e.g., `{1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1}`
- **Equivalent**: Same number of elements  
  e.g., `{a, b, c}` and `{1, 2, 3}` are equivalent but not equal

---

## 3. Set Notation and Representation

### 🔹 Roster Form
- List all elements  
  e.g., `A = {1, 2, 3, 4}`

### 🔹 Set-builder Form
- Describe properties of elements  
  e.g., `B = {x | x is an even number less than 10}`

**Interesting Note**: The vertical bar `|` in set-builder form means “such that”.

## 4. Subsets and Supersets

### 🔹 Subset (⊆)
- `A ⊆ B`: All elements of set A are also in set B  
  e.g., `A = {1, 2}` is a subset of `B = {1, 2, 3}`

### 🔹 Proper Subset (⊂)
- A subset that is **not equal** to the original set  
  e.g., `{1, 2} ⊂ {1, 2, 3}`

### 🔹 Superset (⊇ or ⊃)
- `B ⊇ A`: Set B contains all elements of set A  
  `B ⊃ A` if it's a **proper superset**

## 5. Venn Diagrams

Venn diagrams are **visual tools** to represent sets and their relationships.

- **Circles** represent sets
- **Overlaps** show common elements (intersection)
- **Outside** areas represent the universal set

**Shortcut Tip**: Use Venns to easily understand set operations visually!

## 6. Set Operations

### 🔹 Union ( ∪ )
- Combines all elements from both sets  
  `A ∪ B = {elements in A or B}`

### 🔹 Intersection ( ∩ )
- Common elements between sets  
  `A ∩ B = {elements in both A and B}`

### 🔹 Difference (−)
- Elements in one set but **not** in another  
  `A − B = {elements in A not in B}`

### 🔹 Complement ( A′ )
- Elements in the universal set **not** in A  
  `A′ = {x | x ∈ U and x ∉ A}`

**Examples**:
- Let `A = {1, 2, 3}`, `B = {2, 3, 4}`
  - `A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
  - `A ∩ B = {2, 3}`
  - `A − B = {1}`
  - If universal set `U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, then `A′ = {4, 5}`

---

## 7. Universal Set and Complement

- The **universal set** (U) contains all possible elements under consideration.
- The **complement** of a set includes everything **not** in that set but **within** the universal set.

**Example**:
- `U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `A = {2, 4}`
- Then `A′ = {1, 3, 5}`

---

## 8. Real-Life Applications of Sets

- **Grouping items**: Books by genre, students by grade
- **Categorization**: Emails (read/unread), playlists (liked songs)
- **Logic**: If-then rules, decision trees
- **Probability**: Events as sets in a sample space

**Fun Activity**:
- Create your own sets from daily life (e.g., your favorite foods, apps on your phone).

## 📝 Practice Questions

1. List 3 examples of finite sets and 2 of infinite sets.
2. Identify which of the following are subsets:
   - `A = {1, 2, 3}`, `B = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
   - `C = {a, b}`, `D = {b, c}`
3. Use Venn diagrams to show:
   - `A = {1, 2, 3}`, `B = {2, 3, 4}`
   - Find `A ∪ B`, `A ∩ B`, `A − B`, `B − A`
4. Find the complement of `A = {1, 2, 5}` in universal set `U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
