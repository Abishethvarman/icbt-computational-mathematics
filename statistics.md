# Statistics - Beginner Session Outline

## 1. Introduction to Statistics

### What is Statistics?

* **Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Importance:

* Helps in decision making, identifying trends, and supporting scientific research.

### Types of Data:

* **Qualitative (Categorical)**: Descriptive data (e.g., colors, gender, types of cars)
* **Quantitative (Numerical)**: Measurable data (e.g., age, height, scores)

  * **Discrete**: Countable (e.g., number of students)
  * **Continuous**: Measurable (e.g., temperature, weight)

## 2. Organizing and Presenting Data

### Frequency Distribution:

* Table that displays the frequency of various outcomes in a sample.

### Graphical Representations:

* **Bar Chart**: Used for categorical data
* **Pie Chart**: Shows proportional data
* **Histogram**: Used for continuous data
* **Line Graph**: Trends over time

### Example:

```
Age (years):     10  11  12  13
Number of students: 3   5   7   4
```

Represent as a bar chart.

## 3. Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean (Average):

* Sum of all values divided by number of values
* Example: (2+4+6)/3 = 4

### Median:

* Middle value when data is arranged in order
* If even number of values: take average of middle two

### Mode:

* Most frequently occurring value
* A data set may have more than one mode

### Choosing the Right Measure:

* **Mean**: Good for symmetrical data
* **Median**: Better for skewed data
* **Mode**: Used for categorical data

## 4. Measures of Dispersion (Spread)

### Range:

* Difference between highest and lowest values
* Example: Max = 10, Min = 4, Range = 6

### Variance and Standard Deviation:

* **Variance**: Average of squared differences from the Mean
* **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance

#### Formulas:

* **Sample variance (s²)**: $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$
* **Population variance (σ²)**: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}$
* **Standard deviation**: $\sqrt{\text{variance}}$

### Interpretation:

* Small SD: Data is close to mean
* Large SD: Data is spread out

## 5. Probability Basics

### What is Probability?

* Measure of likelihood that a particular event will occur

### Key Terms:

* **Experiment**: Action with uncertain result (e.g., rolling a die)
* **Outcome**: Result of a single trial (e.g., getting a 5)
* **Event**: One or more outcomes (e.g., getting an odd number)

### Formula:

$P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$

### Independent and Dependent Events:

* **Independent**: One event does not affect the other (e.g., coin tosses)
* **Dependent**: One event affects the other (e.g., drawing cards without replacement)

### Example:

* Probability of rolling a 3 on a fair die: $\frac{1}{6}$

---

## 6. Accuracy and Precision

### Accuracy:

* How close a measured value is to the actual (true) value

### Precision:

* How close measured values are to each other (consistency)

### Example:

* If measurements are: 5.0, 5.1, 4.9, then it's **precise**.
* If the actual value is 5.0, and you get 5.0, it's **accurate**.
